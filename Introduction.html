<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	About a couple of years ago, simple electronic instrument was introduced in a magazine called "Adult science Magazine". It's called Pocket miku, which can make Miku's singing voice with simple keyboard.
</p>
<p>
	My Inspiration came here, which was implementing this instrument on the web.
</p>
	<h2>Development Process</h2>
<p>
	Since I own legit VOCALOID V3 Program with Hatsune miku V3 software, I extracted every single pronounciation as short wav file.
</p>
<p>
	The problem was that, not every pronounciation had same Attack timing, so I carefully cut the front part of wav file as far as I could.
</p>
<p>
	I also tried to load and connect the voice wav file to the AudioBuffer nodes, but HTML didn't allow use one xmlHttpRequest on multiple files. It might still be possible if I try to create xmlHttpRequest variable for few hundreds of files.
</p>
<p>
	Then, I implemented input part, which is basically done only on keyboard. The singing voice only sounds when the key is pressed. If it is released, instantly the voice stops.
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, it is possible to adjust singing duration with one note up to 3 seconds(maximum length of records)
</p>
<p>
	HTML Button tags don't work as they are clicked; They are just there for input feedback. It responds to corresponding Key that is assigned, from 1 to 5 and Q to T for consonent, and A to G for vowel.
